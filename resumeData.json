    "bio1": "I graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and commissioned as a Naval Officer in May 2017. I began my Naval career as a nuclear submarine officer where I underwent rigorous academic training at both the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, SC and the Nuclear Power Training Unit in Ballston Spa, NY. In November 2018, I transitioned into the Information Warfare Community as a Naval Intelligence Officer where I specialized in Aviation Intelligence. In May 2020, I transitioned into the civilian sector and currently live in San Diego with my wife and puppy.",
    "bio2": "My journey as a Software Engineer started June 2020 when I began a 12-week coding bootcamp at the University of California, San Diego Extension. I excelled during the program with the help of my background in mathematics and military training. I was able to collaborate with many other talented junior developers during the bootcamp, which I enjoyed greatly. The amazing projects my teammates and I were able to create in such a limited amount of time is something that I am extremely proud of. Please take a look at some of the projects below and feel free to contact me with any questions! ",
